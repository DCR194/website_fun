## Welcome to My Blog!

Hi, I am sorry, some of what's below was generated by AI. I just wanted to get a quick introduction
to my blog and this is the template Dr.Gpt gave me.


### What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:
- Projects I am working on
- Projects I should be working on but I am procrastinating
- Rants nobody wants to hear
- Pictures of my cute dog :)
- Whatever I am interested at the time
- My objectively right opinions
- My objectively wrong opinions
- The literary significance of blood on snow
- bad bad bad jokes
- Me fanboying over chess/music/my beautiful, charismatic, and awesome gf
- How The Killers saved Christmas with "Don't Shoot Me Santa"
- My predictions on when chat gpt will take over
- How I welcome our new AI overlords
- Low-Level coding supremacy

### Why Start a Blog?
Because it's fun, but also:

1. Scream into the void :D

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
