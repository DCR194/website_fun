## The Party

I spent this new year at the beach with a few of my parents' friends. For them, it has become
a tradition which I expect (and hope) will go on for many more years. I really like the story of
how they met. Although this blog is just a quick introduction to this new year, the brief version
is as follows: They met in their late 20s/early 30s and stayed together due to a shared love of music. I really like that.
To me, it shows that you are never too old to meet the people who will change your life.

Today I wanted to reflect on something else which has captivated me since I was a kid, fireworks.
This is the first New Year's Eve whithout my brother. And even though he will come home in a few days,
I do miss him a lot. One peculiar reason is because of this association I have in my mind with christmas
and me and my brother blowing up stuff with fireworks. As the first seconds of this new year passed by I
looked up from the sandy landscape and I saw thousands of fireworks being lit up at the same time over
miles and miles of coast. That's when it came to me, the same feeling of awe of the first
time I saw the bright-colored trails and beautiful patterns we made in the night sky. Despite fireworks being the most
literal form of seeing your money go up in flames, we all agreed that in this special day once a year
we would all collectively wage war at the sky. Because we do not want to start off a new year in darkness,
so we make our own light.
